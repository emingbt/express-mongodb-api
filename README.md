# Project setup

This is a simple example of how to use express mongodb and mongoose to create simple REST APIs. Beside these technologies, I have also used Nodemailer, JWT, bcrypt, Jest, Supertest, and Docker.

## Install dependencies

```
docker-compose build
```

## Run the project

Before running the project, make sure your have .env file in the root directory. You can use the .env.sample file in the docs folder as a reference.

```
docker-compose up
```

## How to use the APIs

You can find the postman collection in the docs folder. Import the collection and you can use the APIs. You can also use the APIs in the browser. The APIs are self explanatory.
